This article contains examples of embedded files. It is part of the [writing articles tutorial](TODO). Please refer to the tutorial for an explanation of the
following examples.

# Embedded Markdown
[!include[markdown](./fileToEmbed.md)]  

Note: if used inline, for example, [!include[markdown](./fileToEmbed.md)], the markdown parser will treat the inserted text as inline content.

# Embedded SVG
[!include[logo](../../resources/logo.svg)]

Note: since markup in markdown is treated as raw markup, markup files (svg or html) can be inserted into an article.
