# Misc Bugs
- Investigate repainting of banner text elements if they aren't assigned `will-change: transform`.
- Chrome issue with animated underline:  
  If a video/image's height is a float, and its decimal portion is close to 0.5, subsequent animated underlines appear fuzzy.
- Category and article menus pop up for a frame when you scroll to the bottom.
