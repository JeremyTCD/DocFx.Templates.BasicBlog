<!-- 
Notes for this ReadMe 
- Be verbose if necessary. Not every reader will have experience with frontend developement.
- Be as accurate as possible with paths, e.g "blog/src/contents", not "src/contents". This improves clarity, especially since directories and files are sometimes copied around.
- Paths must be in italics
- Only qualify directories the first time they are mentioned, e.g "the blog directory". 
- Directories must be in italics.
- All headers must have a link in the table of contents

Mimo is a [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) based tool for generating minimalistic, modern documentation sites/blogs.

At the time of this writing, my [blog](https://www.jeremytcd.com) is generated using Mimo and is a demo of sorts (it does not utilize DocFX's
excellent project metadata generating features etc).

**Coming soon<sup>TM</sup>**
